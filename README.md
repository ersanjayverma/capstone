# AI-Powered Zero Trust Access Control System (ZTACS)

# ðŸ’¡ Combines cybersecurity, DevOps, and AI to secure enterprise systems.

# 

# ðŸš€ Project Summary:

# Build a Zero Trust access control system that uses AI and behavioral analytics to grant or deny access to services (like internal APIs, cloud resources, or microservices). All access is treated as untrusted, even from inside the network.

# 

# ðŸ§± Key Features:

# User \& Service Authentication: JWT/OAuth2 + Device Fingerprinting.

# 

# Real-time Behavior Monitoring: Track login locations, access times, and unusual API usage patterns.

# 

# Anomaly Detection: Train a small ML model (e.g., Isolation Forest or LSTM) to detect suspicious access attempts.

# 

# Policy Engine: Dynamic access control policies based on user role, risk score, and context.

# 

# Audit Trail Dashboard: Full user/service activity logs in Grafana or a custom UI.

# 

# ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:

# Area	Stack

# Backend	C# (.NET), Python (for ML), or Node.js

# Frontend	React or Angular

# Authentication	OAuth2 / OpenID Connect, Azure AD or Auth0

# ML for Anomaly Detect	Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch

# Data Store	PostgreSQL, Redis (session), ElasticSearch (logs)

# DevOps	Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines

# Monitoring	Prometheus, Grafana, Loki
